blurb: 
abstract: There is a growing literature focused on using logical methods to reason about communities of agents engaged in some form of social interaction. Much of the work builds upon existing logical frameworks developed by philosophers and computer scientists incorporating insights and ideas from philosophy (especially epistemology and philosophy of action), game theory, decision theory and social choice theory. The result is a web of logical systems each addressing different aspects of rational agency and social interaction. Rather than providing an encyclopedic account of these different logical systems, this paper focuses on issues surrounding the modeling of informational attitudes in social interactive situations. The main objective is to introduce the two main approaches to modeling "rational interaction" and provide pointers to the current literature.
