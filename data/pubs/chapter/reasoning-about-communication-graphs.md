blurb: 
abstract: Let us assume that some agents are connected by a communication graph. In the communication graph, an edge from agent i to agent j means that agent i can directly receive information from agent j. Agent i can then refine its own information by learning information that j has, including information acquired by j from another agent, k. We introduce a multi-agent modal logic with knowledge modalities and a modality representing communication among agents. Among other properties, we show that the logic is decidable, that it completely characterizes the communication graph, and that it satisfies the basic properties of the space logic of [18].
