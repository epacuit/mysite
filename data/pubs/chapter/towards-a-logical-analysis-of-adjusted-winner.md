abstract: It is often convenient to view a computational procedure, or a program, as a relation on a set of states, where a state can be thought of as a function that assigns a value to every possible variable and a truth value to all propositions.  In this paper, I show how to extend these ideas to verifying correctness of the Adjusted Winner fair division algorithm.
