abstract:  One of the important lessons to take away from Rohit Parikh's impressive body of work is that logicians and computer scientists have much to gain by focusing their attention on the intricacies of political campaigns. Drawing on recent work developing a theory of expressive voting, we study the dynamics of voters' opinions during an election. In this paper, we develop a model in which the relative importance of the different issues that concern a voter may change either in response to candidates' statements during a campaign or due to unforeseen events. We study how changes in a voter's attention to the issues influence voting behavior under voting systems such as plurality rule and approval voting. We argue that it can be worthwhile for candidates to reshape public focus, but that doing so can be a complex and risky activity.
