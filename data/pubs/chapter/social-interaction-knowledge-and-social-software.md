blurb: 
abstract: In [31] a theory of human computation, analogous to Turing's theory of machine computation, is discussed. The issue there is whether there might be an analogue to Church's thesis in this human domain. Examples of human algorithms discussed include the making of scrambled eggs. By comparison, Lynn Stein in this volume discusses the making of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Neither she nor us in this volume have any concern with Church's thesis as such, although that might prove to be a fascinating topic for a future paper. Rather the issue here is interaction, which occurs most naturally in multiagent algorithms, unlike the making of scrambled eggs or peanut butter sandwiches where one agent normally suffices.  Such multiagent algorithms, examples of which are building a house, or playing bridge, are examples of what we shall call social software after [32]. In that paper, one of us asked 'Is it possible to create a theory of how social procedures work with a view to creating better ones and ensuring the correctness of the ones we do have?' The present chapter will survey some of the logical and mathematical tools that have been developed over the years that may help address this question.
