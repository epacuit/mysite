blurb: 
abstract: "In this paper, we investigate the semantics and logic of  *choice-driven counterfactuals*, that is, of counterfactuals whose evaluation relies on auxiliary premises about how agents are expected to act, *i.e.*, about their *default choice behavior*. To do this, we merge one of the most prominent logics of agency in the philosophical literature, namely stit logic  [Belnap et al., 2001; Horty, 2001], with the well-known logic of counterfactuals due to Stalnaker [1968] and Lewis [1973]. A key component of our semantics for counterfactuals is to distinguish between *deviant* and *non-deviant* actions at a moment, where an action available to an agent at a moment is deviant when its performance does not agree with the agent's default choice behavior at that moment. After developing and axiomatizing a stit logic with action types, instants, and deviant actions, we study the philosophical implications and logical properties of two candidate semantics for choice-driven counterfactuals, one called *rewind models* inspired by Lewis [1979] and the other called *independence models* motivated by well-known counterexamples to Lewis's proposal [Slote, 1978]. In the last part of the paper we consider  how to evaluate choice-driven counterfactuals at moments arrived at by some agents performing a deviant action."
