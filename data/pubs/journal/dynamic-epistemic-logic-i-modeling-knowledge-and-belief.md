blurb: 
abstract: Dynamic epistemic logic, broadly conceived, is the study of logics of  *information change*. This is the first paper in a two-part series introducing this research area. In this paper, I introduce the basic logical systems for reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of a group of agents.
