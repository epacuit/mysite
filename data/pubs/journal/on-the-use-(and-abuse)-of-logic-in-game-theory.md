blurb: 
abstract: "A quick glance at the opening paragraphs in many of the classic logic textbooks reveals a common view: Logical methods highlight the reasoning patterns of a single (idealized) agent engaged in some form of mathematical thinking. However, this traditional view of the 'subject matter' of logic is expanding. There is a growing literature using phrases such as 'rational interaction' or 'information flow' to describe its subject matter while still employing traditional logical methods. The clearest example of this can be found in the work of Johan van Benthem and others on logical dynamics; Rohit Parikh and others on social software; Samson Abramsky and others on game semantics for linear logic, and Mike Wooldridge, Valentin Goranko and others on logics for multiagent systems. There are many issues driving this shift in thinking about what logic is about. One important reason for this shift is the close connection between logic and game theory.<br/><br/>For centuries, logicians have used game-theoretic notions in their analyses.  In the past 20 years or so, the influence has started to run in the other direction. There is now a very active research area focused on adapting existing logical systems and developing new ones to reason about different aspects of a game situation. Full coverage of this fascinating research area would require much more space than I have in this  article. So, I  will not attempt a comprehensive overview of the use of logic in game theory and, instead, will focus on just a few key topics."
