blurb: 
abstract: "We propose a new single-winner voting system using ranked ballots: Stable Voting. The motivating principle of Stable Voting is that if a candidate $A$ would win without another candidate $B$ in the election, and $A$ beats $B$ in a head-to-head majority comparison, then $A$ should still win in the election with $B$ included (unless there is another candidate $A'$ who has the same kind of claim to winning, in which case a tiebreaker may choose between such candidates). We call this principle Stability for Winners (with Tiebreaking). Stable Voting satisfies this principle while also having a remarkable ability to avoid tied outcomes in elections even with small numbers of voters."
