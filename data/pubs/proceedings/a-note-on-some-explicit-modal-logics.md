abstract: "Sergei Artemov introduced the Logic of Proofs (LP) as a logic of explicit proofs. There is also an epistemic reading in which t is a *justification$ of P. Motivated, in part, by this epistemic reading, Fitting introduced a Kripke style semantics for LP. In this note, we prove soundness and completeness of some axiom systems which are not covered by Fitting."
