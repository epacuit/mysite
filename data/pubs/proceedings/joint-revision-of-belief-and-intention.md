blurb: 
abstract: We present a formal semantical model to capture action, belief and intention, based on the 'database perspective' (Shoham 2009). We then provide postulates for belief and intention revision, and state a representation theorem relating our postulates to the formal model.  Our belief postulates are in the spirit of the AGM theory; the intention postulates stand in rough correspondence with the belief postulates.
