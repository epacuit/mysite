abstract: We study the notion of assumption-completeness, which is a property of belief models first introduced in [18]. In that paper it is considered a limitative result --- of significance for game theory --- if a given language does not have an assumption-complete belief model. We show that there are assumption-complete models for the basic modal language (Theorem 8).
