abstract: "Finding out what makes two stories equivalent is a daunting task for a formalization of narratives. Using a high-level language of beliefs and preferences for describing stories and a simple algorithm for analyzing them, we determine the doxastic game fragment of actual narratives from the TV crime series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and identify a small number of basic building blocks sufficient to construct the doxastic game structure of these narratives."
