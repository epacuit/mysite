abstract: Results in social choice theory such as the Arrow and Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorems constrain the existence of rational collective decision making procedures in groups of agents. The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem says that no voting procedure is *strategy-proof*. That is, there will always be situations in which it is in a voter's interest to misrepresent its True preferences i.e., vote strategically. We present some properties of strategic voting and then examine -- via a bimodal logic utilizing epistemic and  trategizing modalities -- the knowledge-theoretic properties of voting situations and note that unless the voter *knows* that it should vote strategically, and how, i.e., knows what the *other* voters' preferences are and *which* alternate preference $P'$ it should use, the voter will not strategize. Our results suggest that opinion polls in election situations effectively serve as the first $n-1$ stages in an $n$ stage election.
