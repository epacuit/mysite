blurb: 
abstract: "We propose a hyper-domain semantics to analyze the group reading of epistemic modals according to which the relevant quantificational base for modals is not represented by a single aggregated information state but rather by a set of information states. The resulting framework allows us to capture what we call “epistemic pseudo-agreements”. Additionally, to further investigate the corresponding logic of our hyper-domain semantics, we devise a translation of the consequence relation in our hyper-domain semantics into a new logic called “Logic of Epistemic Disagreement” interpreted over possibility models."
