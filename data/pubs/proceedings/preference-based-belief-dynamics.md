abstract: In this paper, we study an approach first put forward by Stephen Morris in [16] where an agent's (non-probabilistic) beliefs are defined from its preferences. The main idea is to apply the logic of the Savage approach and deduce logical properties of an agent's beliefs (such as positive introspection) from properties of the agent's preferences. What interests us for this paper is the relationship between preference change and belief change. Already in [16], Morris showed how a specific kind of belief change can be related to a consistency requirement on preferences in sequential decision making. Indeed a number of authors have focused on the relationship between so-called 'coherent' choice and (probabilistic) belief revision operators.  In this paper we use an approach similar to Morris' in order to characterize various operations on beliefs in terms of preference changes.
