This course is intended as a first course in logic for students with no previous exposure to the subject. The course is focused on two logical systems: propositional logic and first order logic. For each logical system, we will discuss  the syntax (what it means to construct a well formed sentence in the logic), the semantics (how one decides whether or not a sentence in the logic is true), and a proof theory (how, if you know some true things, you can figure out what else is true).   The main objective   is to become proficient at "elementary" formal reasoning involving propositional and first-order logic.  By the end of the semester students will be able to analyze arguments using propositional or first-order logic;  interpret formulas and proofs in propositional/first-order logic;  and will  be proficient with basic logical concepts.  

Along the way, we will study some of the concepts from set theory (sets, functions, relations) used in the definition of semantic models for logical systems. We may also introduce some alternative, or non-classical logics. Although the subject of symbolic logic was developed by mathematicians and philosophers for their own special purposes (which we will discuss), logical concepts and techniques have found applications in a variety of disciplines, including computer science, economics, law, linguistics, and psychology. We may also consider some of these applications.
