Introduction to deductive and inductive logic. We introduce the syntax (what it means to construct a well-formed sentence in the logic), the semantics (how one decides whether a sentence is true), a proof theory (how, if you know some true things, you can figure out what else is true), and how to translate between the logics and natural language.
