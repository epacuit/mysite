There are two main goals for this course.  The first is to provide a general introduction to game and decision theory with a special focus on the growing body of literature surrounding the so-called *epistemic* foundations of game theory.   Epistemic game theory aims at formalizing  assumptions about knowledge, belief and rationality,  and then studies their behavioral implications in games.   The second goal  is to carefully examine the   assumptions that are built into any game-theoretic model of social interaction. We will finish the course by discussing some broader issues  surrounding  the role that mathematical models play in the social sciences and the how to interpret a game-theoretic model. 

Some previous exposure to game and decision theory will be helpful, but is not required (I will do my best to provide the necessary background in  game  and decision theory.   This will include a tutorial on the basic concepts of game and decision theory during the first lecture and additional  lectures on background material as needed during the semester).   This is an interdisciplinary topic, and so our readings will be taken from economics, logic, philosophy and cognitive science journals.
