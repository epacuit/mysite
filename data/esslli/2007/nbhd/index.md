Dana Scott and Richard Montague (influenced by a paper written by McKinsey and Tarski in 1944) proposed independently in 1970 a new semantic framework for the study of modalities, which today is known as neighborhood semantics. The semantic framework permits the development of elegant models for the family of classical modal logics, including many interesting non-normal modalities from Concurrent Propositional Dynamic Logic, to Coalitional Logic to various monadic operators of high probability used in various branches of game theory. I will introduce neighborhood semantics for modal logic and discuss some applications. The main goal of the corse is to understand the basic techniques and results of neighborhood semantics for modal logics and to understand the exact relationship between the standard relational semantics and neighborhoood semantics for modal logics.
