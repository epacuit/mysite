Questions of collective agency and collective intentionality are not
new in philosophy, but in recent years they have increasingly been 
investigated using _logical_}_ methods. The work of
Bacharach, Sugden~  and
Tumela, in particular, elegantly combines 
philosophical relevancy with a strong inclination towards logical
modeling of decision and action. 

<br />

Logical and algebraic approaches are also more and more present in
foundations of decision theory,
epistemic game theory, and
dynamic epistemic logic, three areas
of research where questions of group and interactive agency also
naturally arise. In these field of research, however, group agency is
rather studied from the perspective of individual decision makers,
with the aim of understanding how the former stem from mutual
expectations of the latter.

<br />

Little is known, however, about how to understand the relation between these 
views on interaction and collective agency. On the
one hand, decision- and game-theoretical approaches build on
resolutely individualistic premises, and study the logic of individual
belief and preferences in interactive decision making. On the other
hand, the aforementioned philosophical theories take a more
collectivist standpoint, focusing on how decision makers engage in
"group", "team" or "we-mode" of reasoning, which is often claimed to involve irreducibly collective attitudes. 

<br />


This course aims at studying these bodies of literature in order to
clarify their relation, both from a logical and a conceptual point of
view. It will first cover recent development in the foundations of
decision theory and epistemic foundations of
equilibrium play in interaction. It will then move
to the three philosophical theories of group agency mentioned above and,
using logic as a common denominator, try to understand how they relate
to decision- and game-theoretical approaches.
