Game Theory studies rational decision making in situations of interdependent decisions, where the outcome of one's choice depends on what others decide. "Real" games like chess or Go are obvious examples, but game-theoretical models have proved useful to analyze a much broader range of phenomena, from bargaining situations, both by real and artificial agents, to conventions like driving behavior and language. In such situations, rational deliberation about what to do should take into account not only what one expects the others will do, but also what one believes about others' beliefs. Taking this intuition seriously is the trademark of contemporary *epistemic* game theory, a discipline that has by now a few decades of fruitful interaction between logic and economics on its record. 


<br />


This course is a general introduction to epistemic game theory, with a strong accent on logical approaches to the discipline. We will start by introducing the decision-theoretic background, as well as the game-theoretical basics. We will then move to epistemic game theory proper, by presenting modern logical tools to represent information in interactive contexts, and looking in detail at the classic results in the field, both on so-called strategic form games, "matrices", and extensive form games, "trees". Towards the end of the course, we will connect with the more recent logical literature on information (dynamics), preferences and actions, showing that they offer a new perspective on the game-theoretic results. 

<br />

The course should be of interest for students in philosophy, computer science (especially multi-agent systems) and linguistics (especially those interested in formal pragmatics). It will be self-contained, thus does not require previous knowledge of the logical or game- and decision-theoretical material that we will cover. We only assume a reasonable level of mathematical maturity.
