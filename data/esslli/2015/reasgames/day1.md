I introduced the basics of decision theory: Decision problems, strict/weak
dominance, expected utility, minmax regret, ordinal/cardinal utilities. We
discussed the von Neumann-Morgenstern Theorem and Newcomb's paradox. We
concluded with a brief discussion of ratifiability (focusing on the Death in
Damascus problem).
