Reasoning about conditionals, such as ``If I do action $a$, the outcome will be $c$", plays an important role when studying the foundations of game theory. This course will  introduce  game theory with a special emphasis on the puzzles and paradoxes that involve reasoning about conditionals (such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Aumann-Stalnaker debate about backwards induction). This course will provide a solid foundation for students interested in studying the semantics of conditionals and for students interested in using ideas from  game theory in their own field of study.
