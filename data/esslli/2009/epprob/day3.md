Dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) adds a PDL-style dynamic operator to the basic epistemic language. Event models describe abstract epistemic events (eg., public or private announcements, misperceptions, etc.) and the product update rule describes how these events change an initial epistemic model. This lecture described how to define product update in the probabilistic epistemic logics we have been discussing.
