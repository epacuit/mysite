We concluded with some discussion about compactness of the logical systems we discussed in this course. We then turned to Dutch book theorems. A proof of both the synchronic and diachronic Dutch book theorems was presented. Finally we discussed a number of puzzles that have been discussed in the literature (the Cable Guy Paradox, Sleeping Beauty Problem and the Two Envelope Problem).
