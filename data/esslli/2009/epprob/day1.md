Todays lecture started with some general discussion about what we will cover in the course. The first part half of the lecture discussed some motivating examples. Specifically, we discusses Robert Aumann's seminal result that (assuming a common prior) there cannot be common knowledge that the posteriors are different. The second half of the lecture covered a number of basic results in measure theory. We will return to these results tomorrow when going through the completeness proofs.
