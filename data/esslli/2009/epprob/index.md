Both logic and probability provide powerful tools for reasoning about uncertainty in a dynamic environment. Our goal in this course is to examine logical frameworks that incorporate probabilistic modeling of multiagent uncertainty. We will then see how merging these two perspectives on uncertainty can help clarify various conceptual issues and puzzles (such as the Monty Hall puzzle or the sleeping beauty problem). The primary objective is to explore the formal tools used by logicians, computer scientists, philosophers and game theorists for modeling uncertainty. We will focus on both the important conceptual issues (eg., Dutch book arguments, updating with probability zero events and higher-order probabilities) and the main technical results (eg., completeness and decidability of probabilistic modal logics). 


<br />


This course is a general introduction to epistemic game theory, with a strong accent on logical approaches to the discipline. We will start by introducing the decision-theoretic background, as well as the game-theoretical basics. We will then move to epistemic game theory proper, by presenting modern logical tools to represent information in interactive contexts, and looking in detail at the classic results in the field, both on so-called strategic form games, "matrices", and extensive form games, "trees". Towards the end of the course, we will connect with the more recent logical literature on information (dynamics), preferences and actions, showing that they offer a new perspective on the game-theoretic results. 

<br />

The course should be of interest for students in philosophy, computer science (especially multi-agent systems) and linguistics (especially those interested in formal pragmatics). It will be self-contained, thus does not require previous knowledge of the logical or game- and decision-theoretical material that we will cover. We only assume a reasonable level of mathematical maturity.
