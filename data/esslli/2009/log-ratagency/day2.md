Todays lecture introduced a number of (modal) logics for reasoning about different aspects of agency. We spent most of the time discussing the main intuitions underlying the specific formalisms. We discussed epistemic logic, propositional dynamic logic (as a logic of action), and stit logics and logics of agency.
