This course will focus primarily on the following question: how to merge logical systems addressing different aspects of (rational) agency. The first half of the lecture discussed a number of general issues surrounding logics of rational agency. We also looked in some detail about a fair division algorithm called Adjusted Winner (eg., discussed the fact that Adjusted Winner is proportional, envy-free and Pareto efficient. Also we discussed an example demonstrating that agents can manipulate the outcome by misrepresenting their preferences (although being truthful is the only way to guarantee at least 50%).

The second half of the course was a very quick introduction to modal logic. We introduced the basic semantics and discussed what the basic modal language can and cannot express.
