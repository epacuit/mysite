Starting from the work of Ramsey (1926); de Finetti (1937); von Neumann
and Morgenstern (1944) and Savage (1954), the formal analyses carried in
decision and game theory have provided important insights for the theory of
rational decision making. More recently, the epistemic program in game theory (Harsanyi, 1967-68; Aumann, 1999; Brandenburger, 2007) has highlighted
the importance of mutual expectations for the understanding of interactive rationality, that is for rational decision making in situation of social interaction.

<br />

Game theory has inherited from decision theory its instrumental stance
on rationality. In both disciplines to choose rationally is to choose, in the light
of one’s expectations, the best means to achieve one’s ends. Decision theory
studies instrumental rationality in situations where one agent chooses among
various actions on the basis of their expected consequences. Crucially, in
decision theoretic scenario it is the agent’s environment, or “Nature”, which
determines the consequences of his actions. Game theory, on the other hand,
is concerned with the interaction of many rational decision makers. Here the consequences of one agent’s decision depends on the choices of all the agents
involved in the situation. The expectations of an individual each decision
makers are thus no more about a “passive” or “external” environment, but
rather about the choices and thus also expectations of other rational decision
makers.

<br />

Acknowledging this apparently small difference, one vs many agents, complicates the picture of instrumental rationality. In games the players’ expectations become interrelated: what one expects from his opponents depends
on what one thinks the others expect from him, and what the others expect
from a given player depends on what they think his expectations about them
are. Dynamic epistemic logic provides here a fruitful environment to study
such entangled expectations. It allows for an elegant analysis of information
and information about information, that is of higher-order information.

<br />


In this course we will study various foundational issues that arise from the
epistemic outlook on games, and show how dynamic epistemic logic (Plaza,
1989; Baltag et al., 1998; van Benthem, 2003; van Ditmarsch et al., 2007)
sheds new lights on them. We will, in other words, take a “logical” perspective
on conceptual problems regarding the notion of rationality, expectations and
choices in interactive situations. The kind of problems that we are interested
in and the methods we draw from make the present course a contribution to
contemporary formal epistemology (Fitelson, 2006; Hendricks, 2006), while
our emphasis on interaction and is also relevant for social software Parikh
(2002).

<br />


This course is a general introduction to epistemic game theory, with a strong accent on logical approaches to the discipline. We will start by introducing the decision-theoretic background, as well as the game-theoretical basics. We will then move to epistemic game theory proper, by presenting modern logical tools to represent information in interactive contexts, and looking in detail at the classic results in the field, both on so-called strategic form games, "matrices", and extensive form games, "trees". Towards the end of the course, we will connect with the more recent logical literature on information (dynamics), preferences and actions, showing that they offer a new perspective on the game-theoretic results. 

<br />

The course should be of interest for students in philosophy, computer science (especially multi-agent systems) and linguistics (especially those interested in formal pragmatics). It will be self-contained, thus does not require previous knowledge of the logical or game- and decision-theoretical material that we will cover. We only assume a reasonable level of mathematical maturity.
