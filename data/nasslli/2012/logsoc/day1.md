  Much of our daily lives are spent taking part in various types of social procedures. Examples range from voting in a national election to deliberating with others in small committees. Many interesting issues arise when we carefully examine our group decision-making processes. For example, suppose that a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which restaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide where to go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a choice that is 'fair' taking into account everyone's opinions or must we choose one person to act as a `dictator'? In this introductory lecture, I motivate and discuss the central problems of social choice theory and highlight a few key paradoxes. Background reading includes:
