Social Choice Theory is the formal analysis of collective decision making. A growing number of logical systems incorporate insights and ideas from this important field. This course will introduce the key results (including proofs) and the main research themes of Social Choice Theory. The primary objective is to introduce the main mathematical methods and conceptual ideas found in the Social Choice literature. I will also pay special attention to recent logical systems that have been developed to reason about group decision making and how social choice-style analyses are being used by logicians. Specific topics include (a schedule and list of topics is available below) 

<br />

- Proofs of key Social Choice results (eg., Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, Sen's Impossibility of the Paretian Liberal, and the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem),
- Axiomatic characterizations of voting methods (May's Characterization of the majority rule, Maskin's Characterization of majority rule, Fishburn's Characterization of Approval Voting, Young's Characterization of scoring rules, Saari's characterization of Borda Count),
- Voting paradoxes (eg., Condorcet's paradox, Anscombe's Paradox, the No-Show Paradox),
- Generalizations of the classic framework (eg., assuming there are infinitely many voters, Saari's geometric approach to social choice, judgement aggregation), and
- Modal preference logics for reasoning about multiagent preference aggregation.
- Applications of Arrow's Theorem outside of the theory of group decision making

The course will not only provide a broad overview of the field of Social Choice from a logicians perspective, but will also discuss key technical results of particular interest to logicians. The main goal is to provide a solid foundation for students that want to incorporate results and ideas from Social Choice Theory into their field of study.
