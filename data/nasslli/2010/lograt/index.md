This course will introduce logics for reasoning about communities of rational and not-so rational agents engaged in some form of social interaction. Much of this work builds upon existing logical frameworks developed by philosophers and computer scientists incorporating insights and ideas from philosophy, game theory, decision theory and social choice theory. The result is a web of logical systems each addressing different aspects of rational agency and social interaction. Rather than providing an encyclopedic account of these different logical systems, we will focus on the main conceptual and technical issues that drive a logical analysis. The main objective is to see the various logical systems as a coherent account of rational agency and social interaction. The course will not restrict attention to any one specific logical framework. Rather, the primary objective will be to discuss a number of different logical frameworks toward the goal of understanding how they work together.
